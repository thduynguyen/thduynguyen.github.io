    <richText>This is a joint project with &lt;a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yjian6/"&gt;Yong-Dian Jian&lt;/a&gt; during my second year in Georgia Tech, to experiment with using Lego cube for Augmented Reality applications. We utilize the Lego&#x2019;s 3D model, which could be built easily, and develop a model-based edge tracking to track the 3D Lego cube in real-time. &#xD;&#xD;The Lego cube exposes interesting challenges for tracking algorithm. Its lack of texture fails most methods relying on point features. We use Canny method to extract edges from the capture image, however, the result is very unstable with many noisy edges from the background and shadow, and missing edges in the Lego model due to color similarity between some faces. Inspired by a paper of Georg Klein, we experimented with particle filter for edge tracking. The performance was improved but still unstable. The final stable result as you see in the video below was done with traditional Gauss-Newton non-linear least square optimization combine with many small tricks. :-)&#xD;&#xD;We would love to continue this project and make it more robust in the future.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nugeIPLppw"&gt;Video&lt;/a&gt;: &#xD;&#xD;</richText>
