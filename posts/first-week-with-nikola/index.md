# Nikola is awesome

I wanted to have a light-weight blogging system which allows me to post ipynb online. **Nikola** is much easier to use than Jekyll. It has all the plugins to convert markdown and ipynb. It's also super easy to deploy Nikola on Github Pages, although this site supports Jekyll by default.

I found the zen-ipython theme is nice, but I like the simplicity of the default ipython theme better.

Now I just need to focus on the _content_.
